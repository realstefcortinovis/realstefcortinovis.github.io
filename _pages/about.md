I'm a third year DPhil student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Mark van der Wilk](https://mvdw.uk/) and [François Caron](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/francois-caron). I'm particularly interested in e-values, prediction-powered inference, and anytime-valid confidence sequences—methods that enable rigorous, sequentially valid learning and uncertainty quantification in adaptive workflows. I'm excited about bridging theory and practice to make these ideas useful in real-world machine learning.

Prior to coming to Oxford, I studied at Bocconi University in Milan. In my free time, I enjoy running, playing chess and coming up with new recipes!
