<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I’m a third year DPhil student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, supervised by <a href="https://mvdw.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mark van der Wilk</a> and <a href="https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/francois-caron" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">François Caron</a>. I’m particularly interested about e-values, prediction-powered inference, and anytime-valid confidence sequences—methods that enable rigorous, sequentially valid learning and uncertainty quantification in adaptive workflows. I’m excited about bridging theory and practice to make these ideas useful in real-world machine learning.</p> <p>Prior to coming to Oxford, I studied at Bocconi University in Milan. In my free time, I enjoy running, dominating low-rank players on <a href="https://www.chess.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">chess.com</a> and rating <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MealDealRates/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tesco Meal Deals</a>.</p> <p>Feel free to reach out to me via email or connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefano-cortinovis/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>!</p> </body></html>
